This is my final year project for a bachelor's degree of computer science in Universiti Sains Malaysia. The title is "ShopMate: An Online Shopping Assistance App". The Android mobile app is developed in Android Studio and using Java.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Covid-19 pandemic has caused more people interested in online shopping as to reduce close contact with others. People nowadays used to do things in a faster pace thus making price comparisons between different e-commerce sites and doing analysis before purchasing will be time-consuming.

ShopMate is an Android application that developed to assist people to do online shopping more effectively. The objectives of ShopMate application are to saves user time in making price comparisons and to provide insights to help users to make better purchasing decision.

To do that, ShopMate uses web scraping method to get item data from Lazada and Shopee websites so that users can make price comparisons in this application. ShopMate provides also a price tracking function where the user can save their desired items into the price tracking list and they will get notified when there is a price drop of the items. Besides, ShopMate applies deep learning technologies such as RNN model to perform sentiment analysis on the products reviews to provide some insight. Then, the item in the compare list is recommended to user based on a recommendation algorithm.

In short, ShopMate is expected to assist users to buy items at a cheaper and desired price as well as to avoid low-quality items.
